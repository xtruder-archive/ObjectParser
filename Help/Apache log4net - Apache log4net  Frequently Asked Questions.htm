                    <P>
                        log4net is a tool to help the programmer output log statements to a variety of 
                        output targets.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        In case of problems with an application, it is helpful to enable logging so 
                        that the problem can be located. With log4net it is possible to enable logging at 
                        runtime without modifying the application binary. The log4net package is designed 
                        so that log statements can remain in <I>production</I> code without incurring a 
                        high performance cost. It follows that the speed of logging (or rather not 
                        logging) is crucial.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        At the same time, log output can be so voluminous that it quickly becomes 
                        overwhelming. One of the distinctive features of log4net (and common to all of
                        the log4x libraries) is the notion of <I>hierarchical 
                        loggers</I>. Using these loggers it is possible to selectively control 
                        which log statements are output at arbitrary granularity.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        log4net is designed with two distinct goals in mind: speed and flexibility. There 
                        is a tight balance between these two requirements.
                    </P>

                <A name="Is log4net a reliable logging system?"></A><DIV class="section"><H2>Is log4net a reliable logging system?</H2>
                    <P>
                        No. log4net is not reliable. It is a best-effort and <EM>fail-stop</EM> logging system.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        By fail-stop, we mean that log4net will not throw unexpected exceptions at 
                        run-time potentially causing your application to crash. <B>If for any reason, log4net 
                        throws an uncaught exception</B> (except for <SPAN class="code">ArgumentException</SPAN> and 
                        <SPAN class="code">ArgumentNullException</SPAN> which may be thrown), <B>please send an email 
                        to the <A href="mailto:log4net-user@logging.apache.org">
                        log4net-user@logging.apache.org</A> mailing list</B>. Uncaught exceptions 
                        are handled as serious bugs requiring immediate attention.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Moreover, log4net will not revert to <SPAN class="code">System.Console.Out</SPAN>
                        or <SPAN class="code">System.Console.Error</SPAN> when its designated 
                        output stream is not opened, is not writable or becomes full. This avoids 
                        corrupting an otherwise working program by flooding the user's terminal because 
                        logging fails. However, log4net will output a single message to 
                        <SPAN class="code">System.Console.Error</SPAN> and <SPAN>System.Diagnostics.Trace</SPAN>
                        indicating that logging can not be performed.
                    </P>

                    <P>
                        log4net runs on many different frameworks and each framework has its own requirements.
                        As a rule of thumb you will need an ECMA-335 compliant CLI runtime, for example, 
                        the Microsoft .NET runtime 1.0 (1.0.3705) or 1.1 (1.1.4322).
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Not all frameworks are created equal and some features have been excluded from 
                        some of the builds. See the <A href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/release/framework-support.html">Framework Support</A> 
                        document for more information.

                        The logger concept lies at the heart of log4net's configuration. Loggers are organized into a 
                        hierarchy and give the programmer <EM>run-time</EM> control on which logging statements 
                        are printed or not.
                    
                    
                        Loggers are assigned levels through the configuration of log4net. A log statement is 
                        routed through to the appender depending on its level <EM>and</EM> its logger.

                        your proprietary log4net extensions.</EM> In particular, you may choose to

                    <P>
                        We are very careful not to unnecessarily change the log4net client API so that newer log4net 
                        releases are backward compatible with previous versions. We are a lot less 
                        scrupulous with the internal log4net API. Thus, if your extension is designed to 
                        work with the internals of a specific log4net version, then when the next release
                        of log4net comes out, you will probably need to adapt your proprietary extensions to the 
                        new release. Thus, you will be forced to spend precious resources in order to 
                        keep up with log4net changes. This is commonly referred to as the "stupid-tax". 
                        By donating the code and making it part of the standard distribution, you save 
                        yourself the unnecessary maintenance work.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        If your extensions are useful then someone will eventually write an extension 
                        providing the same or very similar functionality. Your development effort will 
                        be wasted.

                    <P>
                        Unless the proprietary log4net extension is business critical, there is little 
                        reason for not donating your extensions back to the project.

                        log4net is a port of the popular <A href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/">log4j</A> logging library.
                        The initial port was done in June 2001, since then we have tried to remain in the
                        spirit of the original log4j. See the log4net <A href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/history.html">history</A> page for more details.

                    <P>
                        Logging behavior can be set using configuration files which are parsed at runtime. 
                        Using configuration files the programmer can define loggers and set their 
                        levels.

                    <P>
                        Configuration files are specified in XML. See <SPAN class="code">log4net.Config.XmlConfigurator</SPAN>

                        Setting the <SPAN class="code">Threshold</SPAN> on the Hierarchy to Level OFF will disable all
                        logging from that Hierarchy. This can be done in the log4net configuration file
                        by setting the "threshold" attribute on the log4net configuration element to "OFF".
                        For example:
                    </P>

                    <P>
                        log4net uses public properties to configure components such as
                        Appenders, Layouts, Loggers etc.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Thus, any writable public property in on the appender corresponds to a 
                        configurable option. For example, in <SPAN class="code">RollingFileAppender</SPAN> the 
                        <SPAN class="code">public int MaxSizeRollBackups { set; }</SPAN> property corresponds to 
                        the <SPAN class="code">MaxSizeRollBackups</SPAN> option.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Layouts options are also defined by their writable properties. Same goes for most 
                        other log4net components.

                    <P>
                        Yes it is. Setting the <SPAN class="code">Threshold</SPAN> option of any appender extending 
                        <SPAN class="code">AppenderSkeleton</SPAN>, (most log4net appenders extend 
                        <SPAN class="code">AppenderSkeleton</SPAN>) will filter out all log events 
                        with a <EM>lower</EM> level than the value of the threshold option.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        For example, setting the threshold of an appender to DEBUG will also allow INFO, 
                        WARN, ERROR and FATAL messages to log along with DEBUG messages. (DEBUG is the 
                        lowest level). This is usually acceptable as there is little use for DEBUG 
                        messages without the surrounding INFO, WARN, ERROR and FATAL messages. 
                        Similarly, setting the threshold of an appender to ERROR will filter out DEBUG, 
                        INFO and WARN messages but not ERROR or FATAL messages.
                    </P>

                        This policy usually best encapsulates what the user actually wants to do, as

                    <P>
                        If you must filter events by exact level match, then you can attach a 
                        <SPAN class="code">LevelMatchFilter</SPAN> to any appender to filter out logging 
                        events by exact level match.

                        The fully qualified name for an assembly includes the version, culture and

                        Log4net supports a pattern syntax for setting string properties similar to the 
                        <SPAN class="code">PatternLayout</SPAN> used to format the output messages.
                        This pattern syntax can be used by specifying <SPAN class="code">type="log4net.Util.PatternString"</SPAN>
                        on the string property in the config file. This tells the config parser to pass the
                        value to the <SPAN class="code">PatternString</SPAN> type before converting the result
                        to a string. For details on the patterns supported see the <A href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/release/sdk/log4net.Util.PatternString.html">

                        You can name logging loggers by <STRONG>locality</STRONG>. It turns out that 
                        instantiating a logger in each class, with the logger name equal to the 
                        fully-qualified name of the class, is a useful and straightforward approach of 
                        defining loggers. This approach has many benefits:
                    </P>
                    <UL>
                        <LI>
                            It is very simple to implement.</LI>
                        <LI>
                            It is very simple to explain to new developers.</LI>
                        <LI>
                            It automatically mirrors your application's own modular design.</LI>
                        <LI>
                            It can be further refined at will.</LI>
                        <LI>
                            Printing the logger automatically gives information on the locality of the 
                            log statement.</LI>
                    </UL>
                    
                        However, this is not the only way for naming loggers. A common alternative 
                        is to name loggers by <STRONG>functional areas</STRONG>. For example, the 
                        "database" logger, "remoting" logger, "security" logger, or the "XML" 
                        logger.
                    
                    
                        You may choose to name loggers by functionality and subcategorize by 
                        locality, as in "DATABASE.MyApp.MyClass" or 
                        "DATABASE.MyApp.MyModule.MyOtherClass".
                    
                    
                        <EM>You are totally free in choosing the names of your loggers.</EM> The 
                        log4net package merely allows you to manage your names in a hierarchy. However, 
                        it is your responsibility to define this hierarchy.
                    
                    
                        <B>Note:</B> by naming loggers by locality one tends to name things by 
                        functionality, since in most cases the locality relates closely to 
                        functionality.

                    <P>
                        You can easily retrieve the fully-qualified name of a class in a static block 
                        for class <SPAN class="code">X</SPAN>, with the statement <SPAN class="code">typeof(X).Name</SPAN>. 
                        Note that <SPAN class="code">X</SPAN> is the class name and span an instance.
                        However because the <SPAN class="code">LogManager.GetLogger</SPAN> method is overloaded
                        to take an instance of <SPAN class="code">Type</SPAN> as well as <SPAN class="code">string</SPAN>
                        usually only the type of the class is required.

                        An equivalent and more portable solution, though slightly longer, is to use the declaring type

                        incurs the cost of constructing the message parameter, that is converting both 
                        integer <SPAN class="code">i</SPAN> and <SPAN class="code">entry[i]</SPAN> to 
                        a string, and concatenating intermediate strings. This, regardless of whether 
                        the message will be logged or not.

                    <P>
                        This way you will not incur the cost of parameter construction if debugging is 
                        disabled for logger <SPAN class="code">log</SPAN>. On the other hand, if the logger is 
                        debug enabled, you will incur the cost of evaluating whether the logger is 
                        enabled or not, twice: once in <SPAN class="code">IsDebugEnabled</SPAN> and once in <SPAN class="code">Debug</SPAN>. 
                        This is an insignificant overhead since evaluating a logger takes less than 
                        1% of the time it takes to actually log a statement.

                    <P>
                        So you don't think that the previous FAQ is really the fastest way
                        of not logging? Well there is a faster way but it does have some
                        drawbacks. Starting from: 
                    </P>
                    <DIV class="source"><PRE>if(log.IsDebugEnabled) 
{
    log.Debug("Entry number: " + i + " is " + entry[i]);
}</PRE></DIV>
                    <P>
                        It is possible to further eliminate the calls to <SPAN class="code">IsDebugEnabled</SPAN>
                        so that the call is only made once per logger. If you are using one logger 
                        for each class then you can store the enabled state for the logger in a static
                        variable in the class and then test against this variable:
                    </P>
                    <DIV class="source"><PRE>public class FastLogger
{
    private static readonly ILog log = LogManager.GetLogger(typeof(FastLogger));
    private static readonly bool isDebugEnabled = log.IsDebugEnabled;

    public void MyMethod()
    {
        if(isDebugEnabled) 
        {
            log.Debug("Entry number: " + i + " is " + entry[i]);
        }
    }
}</PRE></DIV>
                    <P>
                        So why exactly is this faster? Well to start with the <SPAN class="code">IsDebugEnabled</SPAN>
                        is not called for each log statement, it is called once per logger. Furthermore as the
                        <SPAN class="code">isDebugEnabled</SPAN> variable is <SPAN class="code">private static readonly</SPAN>
                        the JIT compiler can at <EM>run-time</EM> optimize out the <SPAN class="code">if</SPAN> test altogether. 
                        This means that at runtime the JIT compiler won't even compile the logging statements into native code, i.e.
                        all the logging just disappears.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        So what is the downside to using this? Well one of the clever features of log4net is that
                        you can change the logging configuration while your program is running. If you need to 
                        investigate an issue in your application, you don't have to stop the application, setup the
                        logging and restart the application, you can change the logging configuration and the
                        log4net will reload it (see <SPAN class="code">XmlConfigurator.ConfigureAndWatch</SPAN> APIs for more 
                        information). However if the JIT has compiled out all of the logging statements
                        then they are gone and you can't get them back by reloading the configuration file. Effectively
                        this means that the logging configuration can only be set when the application loads and
                        it cannot be changed at runtime. It is up to you to decide if you need ultimate speed or need
                        to be able to reload the logging configuration while the application is running.

                        By default the <SPAN class="code">FileAppender</SPAN> holds an exclusive write 
                        lock on the log file while it is logging. This prevents other processes from 
                        writing to the file. The <SPAN class="code">FileAppender</SPAN> can be configured
                        to use a different locking model, <SPAN class="code">MinimalLock</SPAN>, that
                        only acquires the write lock while a log is being written. This allows multiple
                        processes to interleave writes to the same file, albeit with a loss in performance.

                        when the <SPAN class="code">Debug</SPAN>, <SPAN class="code">Info</SPAN>, 
                        <SPAN class="code">Warn</SPAN>, <SPAN class="code">Error</SPAN>
                        or <SPAN class="code">Fatal</SPAN> method is invoked. This is unaffected by the time at 
                        which they may arrive at a remote server. Since the timestamps are 
                        transmitted in UTC format by the <SPAN class="code">RemotingAppender</SPAN>, 
                        they all appear in the same time zone as 
                        the host creating the logfile. Since the clocks of various machines may not be 
                        synchronized, this may account for time interval inconsistencies between events 
                        generated on different hosts.

                        If you are configuring log4net programmatically, i.e. by calling the 
                        <SPAN class="code">XmlConfigurator.Configure</SPAN> method then you should do so
                        before you begin logging and it is reasonable to do this very soon after application
                        start.

                    <P>
                        If you are configuring log4net by specifying assembly level attributes on 
                        your assembly then the configuration will be loaded once the first call to
                        the <SPAN class="code">LogManager.GetLogger</SPAN> is made. It is necessary
                        that the first call to <SPAN class="code">LogManager.GetLogger</SPAN> made
                        during the process (or AppDomain) is made from the assembly that has the
                        configuration attributes. Log4net will look only once and only on the first 
                        calling assembly for the configuration attributes.

                        Yes. You can implement the <SPAN class="code">log4net.Layout.ILayout</SPAN> 
                        interface to create you own customized log format, or you can extend the 
                        <SPAN class="code">LayoutSkeleton</SPAN> class which provides a default
                        implementation of the <SPAN class="code">ILayout</SPAN> interface.

                        Yes. You can implement the <SPAN class="code">log4net.Appender.IAppender</SPAN> 
                        interface to create you own customized appender. We recommend that you extend the

                        starting from scratch. You should implement your custom code in a assembly
                        separate from the log4net assembly. To get started it is worth looking at the
                        source of the <SPAN class="code">log4net.Appender.TraceAppender</SPAN> as an
                        example of the minimum amount of code required to get an appender working.

                    <P>
                        There are 2 different ways to enable internal debugging in log4net.
                        These are listed below. The preferred method is to specify
                        the <SPAN class="code">log4net.Internal.Debug</SPAN> option in the application's
                        config file.
                    </P>
                    <UL>
                        <LI>
                            
                                Internal debugging can also be enabled by setting a value in the application's
                                configuration file (not the log4net configuration file, unless the log4net config
                                data is embedded in the application's config file). The <SPAN class="code">log4net.Internal.Debug</SPAN>
                                application setting must be set to the value <SPAN class="code">true</SPAN>.
                                For example:
                            
                            <DIV class="syntax"><PRE class="code">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;
&lt;configuration&gt;
    &lt;appSettings&gt;
        &lt;add key="log4net.Internal.Debug" value="true"/&gt;
    &lt;/appSettings&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;</PRE></DIV>
                            <P>
                                This setting is read immediately on startup an will cause all internal
                                debugging messages to be emitted.
                            </P>
                        </LI>
                        <LI>
                            
                                To enable log4net's internal debug programmatically you need
                                to set the <SPAN class="code">log4net.Util.LogLog.InternalDebugging</SPAN>
                                property to <SPAN class="code">true</SPAN>. Obviously the sooner this
                                is set the more debug will be produced.
                            
                        </LI>
                    </UL>
                    <P>
                        Internal debugging messages are written to the console and to the 
                        <SPAN class="code">System.Diagnostics.Trace</SPAN>
                        system. If the application does not have a console the messages logged
                        there will be lost. Note that an application can redirect the console
                        stream by setting the <SPAN class="code">System.Console.Out</SPAN>. The
                        Trace system will by default send the message to an attached debugger
                        (where the messages will appear in the output window). If the process
                        does not have a debugger attached then the messages are sent to the 
                        system debugger. A utility like DebugView from 
                        <A href="http://www.sysinternals.com/">http://www.sysinternals.com</A>
                        may be used to capture these messages.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        As log4net internal debug messages are written to the <SPAN class="code">System.Diagnostics.Trace</SPAN>
                        system it is possible to redirect those messages to a local file. You can define
                        a trace listener by adding the following to your application's .config file:
                    </P>
                    <DIV class="syntax"><PRE class="code">&lt;configuration&gt;

                &lt;add 
                    name="textWriterTraceListener" 
                    type="System.Diagnostics.TextWriterTraceListener" 
                    initializeData="C:\tmp\log4net.txt" /&gt;
            &lt;/listeners&gt;
        &lt;/trace&gt;
    &lt;/system.diagnostics&gt;

                        Make sure that the process running your application has permission

                    <P>
                        If you are not getting events delivered to the event log this usually indicates 
                        a permissions problem. Basically if the event log does not exist the EventLogAppender 
                        tries to create it, but you need local administrator permissions to create event logs 
                        (just to write into the right bit of the registry). You don't need administrator 
                        permissions to log to an existing event log, but it must exist. If you are using the 
                        event log from a web application or service using the event log can be a little tricky.

                        A web application will run as the user account ASPNET. This account deliberately has

                        account has permission to write to the event log it does not have permission to create 
                        event sources (registry create and write access), which are needed to write to the event log.

                                The installer will need to be run as Administrator (don't they all). See
